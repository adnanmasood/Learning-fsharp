#Learning F# Functional Data Structures and Algorithms

###Get started with F# and explore functional programming paradigm with data structures and algorithms

F# is a multi-paradigm programming language that
encompasses object-oriented, imperative, and functional
programming language properties. The F# functional
programming language enables developers to write simple
code to solve complex problems.

Starting with the fundamental concepts of F# and functional
programming, this book will walk you through basic problems,
helping you to write functional and maintainable code. Using
easy-to-understand examples, you will learn how to design
data structures and algorithms in F# and apply these concepts
in real-life projects. The book will cover built-in data structures
and take you through enumerations and sequences. You will
gain knowledge about stacks, graph-related algorithms, and
implementations of binary trees. Next, you will understand
the custom functional implementation of a queue, review
sets and maps, and explore the implementation of a vector.
Finally, you will find resources and references that will give
you a comprehensive overview of F# eco-system, helping
you to go beyond the fundamentals.

##Who this book is written for
If you have just started your adventure with F#, then this book
will help you take the right steps to become a successful F#
coder. An intermediate knowledge of imperative programming
concepts, and a basic understanding of the algorithms and
data structures in .NET environments using the C# language
and BCL (Base Class Library), would be helpful.


###What you will learn from this book
Familiarize yourself with the functional programming nature of F# and explore its fundamentals

Utilize data structures available in F# and apply recursion and lazy evaluation

Gain insights into functional programming paradigms; dissect F# code and analyze code available in community projects

Build abstract data structures and utilize powerful optimization techniques such as memoization

Explore and test built-in F# bespoke data structures and algorithms

Become resourceful and learn how to easily reuse libraries contributed by the C# and F# community

Understand the trade-offs in selecting purely functional (persistent) over mutable data structures

Implement custom ADT (Abstract Data Type), and discover parallel programming and asynchrony within F#
