F# is a multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming language properties. It enables developers to write simple code to solve complex problems.

Embark on a journey into the world of F# and functional programming with this comprehensive guide. Starting from the foundational concepts of F# and functional programming, this book will empower you to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code. Through easy-to-understand examples, you'll not only grasp the core principles but also learn how to design robust data structures and algorithms using F# and apply these skills to real-world projects.

This book delves into F#'s built-in data structures and guides you through the intricacies of enumerations and sequences. You'll gain expertise in handling stacks, delve into graph-related algorithms, and master the implementation of binary trees. Beyond the basics, you'll discover the art of crafting custom functional queues, explore sets and maps, and unravel the inner workings of vectors. As you progress, you'll also find a wealth of resources and references that offer extensive insight into the F# ecosystem, enabling you to advance beyond the fundamentals and become a proficient F# developer.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this book is your gateway to harnessing the power of F# and functional programming in your software development journey.

## Who this book is written for
This book is your trusted companion for achieving success as an F# coder. While prior experience in imperative programming is advantageous, this book caters to beginners and provides the essential knowledge and guidance to set you on the path to F# mastery. For those with an intermediate knowledge of imperative programming concepts, as well as a basic understanding of algorithms and data structures in .NET environments using the C# language and BCL (Base Class Library), you'll find this book to be a valuable resource. It bridges the gap between your existing skills and the world of functional programming in F#, making your transition seamless and your progress swift.

## What you will learn from this book
- Familiarize yourself with the functional programming nature of F# and explore its fundamentals
- Utilize data structures available in F# and apply recursion and lazy evaluation
- Gain insights into functional programming paradigms; dissect F# code and analyze code available in community projects
- Build abstract data structures and utilize powerful optimization techniques such as memoization
- Explore and test built-in F# bespoke data structures and algorithms
- Become resourceful and learn how to easily reuse libraries contributed by the C# and F# community
- Understand the trade-offs in selecting purely functional (persistent) over mutable data structures
- Implement custom ADT (Abstract Data Type), and discover parallel programming and asynchrony within F#
